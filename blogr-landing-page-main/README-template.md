## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

Buildinng this webpage was very amusing, especialy beceause of the patterns, because I had to figure out technics to try to create a similar webpage as the one already given in form of screenshots.
So along with the excessive use of " position:absolute " to implement patterns. So, I thought of using " background " proprety . But I already used it for color, and as I was trying to get this out, I found that we can used different background propreties and that worked perfectly.
Furthermore, I wanted to add a special touch to my work. I have seen a lot of portfolios via " Awwwards " and the smooth scrolling really caught my attention. So I used a JS code taken from Jonas Schmedtmann whom course helped me so much.

### Continued development

The switch between CSS Grid and Flexbox is a thing that I really want to perfection. Especialy when it comes to media quierries. I want to be smooth and quick in switching between this two technics.
